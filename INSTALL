morantz should be fairly easy to build, but if you want to compile it for some
other OS than Mac OS X / Darwin, you will have to modify the Makefile to suite
your needs.

Both the cli and the daemon now takes a -d argument to specify the device node
(tty) to use, default /dev/tty.usbserial, and a -s option to specify the local
socket to use, default /tmp/morantz.sock. The CLI will only accept one of these
options, while the daemon can take both.

Requirements:
	libevent <http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/>.
	GNU gperf <http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/>.
	To use the volume notifier you will also need Growl <http://growl.info>
		and perl with cpan module Mac::Glue.

Building:
	make
	sudo make install
