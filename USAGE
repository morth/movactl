If you are on Mac OS X and have growl installed the volume notifier will
work automatically after install and relogin.

If you type /usr/local/bin/morantz without argument the available commands
will be listed.

/usr/local/bin/morantz listen volume is used to wait for volume notifications,
the available things to listen for can be seen in notify.h

/usr/local/bin/morantz status volume is a one-shot notify.

Recommendations:
	Butler <http://manytricks.com/butler/> can be used for a more GUI
		control. Use AppleScript with the do shell script command.
		Butler might turn into shareware in the future.
